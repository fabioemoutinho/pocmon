# Pocmon

This is a portfolio project and its objective is to showcase most of the angular features.
My inspiration was Pokemon, and you can try this project at https://pocmon.vercel.app/.
Use arrows or WSAD to move!

I am open for feedback and suggestions. :)

Some angular features I plan to use in the future:
- Separate modules
- Lazy loading modules for each route
- PWA
- Testing

Features used:
- Observables (rxjs)
- Reactive State (ngrx)
- Template managed subscriptions
- ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
- Angular animations
- Angular material
- eslint
- HTTP client

Other stuff I want to improve:
- Better UX
- Mobile friendly interface
- Accessibility
